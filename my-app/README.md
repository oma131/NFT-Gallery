# NFT Gallery

As blockchain technology evolves more data is stored on the blockchain, and querying the blockchain becomes more important. When building some decentralized applications on the blockchain, you will need to query data from the blockchain.

This project I created an NFT Gallery using the Alchemy API to fetch NFTs that belong to a wallet address or collection.

To install dependencies used when creating this Project run this:

``yarn install``

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
